                        worrisome. Here at Ipsos iSay, we're open about what we do, what we don't do, and when we make
                        mistakes. Here are some common questions and concerns that we've received from members.</p>

                    <!-- Question 1 -->

                            <p>Survey questions like "Do you intend to buy this product" are meant to find out what
                                types of people are interested in a product. For example, we already know men are more
                                likely to want to buy a moustache trimmer and women are more likely to buy a curling
                                iron. However, sometimes it's hard to know what types of people would be interested in
                                other certain products, so that's why we ask.</p>

                                membership. If you're still receiving emails after that point, it could be because we
                                have you registered with a different email address. Check the most recent Ipsos iSay
                                email you received to see which address it was sent to, and request your membership
                                termination with that address instead. If you continue to receive surveys more than 7
                                days after you terminated your membership, please Contact Us</p>
